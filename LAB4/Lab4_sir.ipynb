       "  'review': 'Synopsis: On the daily trek from Juarez, Mexico to El Paso, Texas an ever increasing number of female workers are found raped and murdered in the surrounding desert. Investigative reporter Karina Danes (Minnie Driver) arrives from Los Angeles to pursue the story and angers both the local police and the factory owners who employee the undocumented aliens with her pointed questions and relentless quest for the truth.<br /><br />Her story goes nationwide when a young girl named Mariela (Ana Claudia Talancon) survives a vicious attack and walks out of the desert crediting the Blessed Virgin for her rescue. Her story is further enhanced when the \"Wounds of Christ\" (stigmata) appear in her palms. She also claims to have received a message of hope for the Virgin Mary and soon a fanatical movement forms around her to fight against the evil that holds such a stranglehold on the area.<br /><br />Critique: Possessing a lifelong fascination with such esoteric matters as Catholic mysticism, miracles and the mysterious appearance of the stigmata, I was immediately attracted to the \\'05 DVD release `Virgin of Juarez\\'. The film offers a rather unique storyline blending current socio-political concerns, the constant flow of Mexican migrant workers back and forth across the U.S./Mexican border and the traditional Catholic beliefs of the Hispanic population. I must say I was quite surprised by the unexpected route taken by the plot and the means and methods by which the heavenly message unfolds.<br /><br />`Virgin of Juarez\\' is not a film that you would care to watch over and over again, but it was interesting enough to merit at least one viewing. Minnie Driver delivers a solid performance and Ana Claudia Talancon is perfect as the fragile and innocent visionary Mariela. Also starring Esai Morales and Angus Macfadyen (Braveheart).',\n",

      "Wow, what a movie! First of all, the story line is so intersting. It is around 1876 and Japan is on course to introduce western lifestyle in the country. However, the Samurais, the traditional Japanese warriors they do not want to except this novice. Thus emperor of Japan confront them military. In order to train the Japanese military the US army captain (portrayed by Tom Cruise) is invited. During one of the confrontations he is taken as a prisoner by Samurais. He spends in Samurai village several month. He studies their lifestyle, their traditions and realizes that he was on the wrong side of the battlefield. Thus he decides to stand next to the Samurais and fight with them for their freedom.<br /><br />This is an epic movie. It probably can be compared to \"Braveheart\". Tom Cruise is brilliant, his acting is amazing. This is must have for movie lovers. I still do not believe that Oscar committee prefered \"The Lord of the Rings\" to \"The Last Samurai\". This is really dissapointing.\n",

      "Taking the advice from some people here, I found the 2-disc with a few extras at Target. Apparently Target has the exclusive deal on this. The movie is the \"Director's Cut\" with slight variations to the theatrical version. There is no commentary track here. The Special Features are found  on the second disc along with the digital copy. Personally, the digital copy doesn't do a thing for me. First up is \"Reforging The Furture\" which runs 18:59 and shows how the filmmakers reinvented the franchise. Then there are 4 featurettes - \"Digital Destruction\", \"Enlisting The AirForce\", \"An Icon Returns\", \"Stan Winston Shop\". These four total 11:30. So is it worth it to spend the extra cash for just a hand full of extras? I guess, but I would have loved to have more extras including a commentary.\n",

It still features the usual mix of comedy and plot twists galore that the Tenchi Muyo OAVs are well known for. The disc comes with Japanese and English audio which will satisfy fans of both preferences. But special features in this disc are lacking as the only notable feature is a collection of trailers for titles that Pioneer/Geneon recently distributed and licensed back in 2002/ 2003 when this DVD first came out. If you just want the episodes, then this volume of the Tenchi Muyo OAVs is worth purchasing. If you want special features, then try hunting down the Tenchi Muyo Ultimate Edition DVD set which has an extensive offering of special features for fans to go giddy over.\n",

      "This must be one of the best DVDs of opera available.<br />Although it is old (1974) the image quality is more than fair, being a studio production The sound quality is excellent.<br /><br />The director, G&ouml;tz Friedrich, really exhibits his genius in this production.  The sets are wonderful and very atmospheric, with an immense well at the side of the stage and the courtyard of Herod's palace being as it should. The costumes are very good, but above all the acting and the movement of the principles is superb.<br /><br />Teresa Stratas must have given the performance of her life. She is perfect as Salome, playing the part of spoiled little brat that always had to have her own way, ignoring and really not caring about the consequences. She moves so much in tune with Strauss's music, she acts superbly and sings beautifully. Astrid Varnay, although grotesque in appearance portrays superbly the part of her mother. Bernd Weikl is vocally excellent and acts very well as Jochanaan, but he appears rather plumb and overfed for a starving prophet. The rest of the cast is good and Hanna Schwarz, as usual, is an asset to any production.<br />Karl B&ouml;hm and the Vienna Philharmonic provide an immensely rich orchestral sound with a very tight and dramatic conducting from B&ouml;hm.<br /><br />I have seen other productions of Salome on DVD and on the stage. I firmly believe that none of them even begins to approach this one in terms of quality. I recommend this set as being far better than all the others, including Peter Hall's superb production from Covent Garden.<br /><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NVL49W\">R.

      "Supercalifragilisticexpealidocious --- Most Delightful Way!\n",
      "Come along now, children, let's read this review. No straggling now. There you go.<br /><br />I must have only seen \"Mary Poppins\" when I was a little kid because I only barely remembered the movie when I was watching it and definitely didn't remember the plot. Definitely an experience worth having, whether you've seen it once, or many, many times.<br /><br />The basic plot is that two kids have been a real terror to their nannies, but not so much out of meanness as the nannies' domineering personalities. They draw up a list of their needs for a nanny and when the wind changes, Mary Poppins comes, despite their tight-laced fathers' wishes. They're soon off on fantastical adventures that may just change the lifestyle of their entire family! This movie makes important comments about suffrage, structure, and just finding the joy in life. It's supercalifragilisticexpealidocious! (And I didn't even have to look that up!)<br /><br />The movie is presented in wide-screen with fully-restored, bright and colorful animation and practically perfect sound. There's also both a subtitle and a close-caption track, although oddly these differ greatly in what they do and don't pick up on. I ended up keeping on both.<br /><br />Like other recent Disney Platinum releases, this DVD contains a wealth of special features that will help you to enjoy the movie more. Chief among them is a great deleted song. You also get a complete making-of feature, a look at the movie magic, a game, promo posters and trailers and many other simply delightful goodies.<br /><br />Like the \"Aladdin\" release, this release is loaded with both a commentary track and pop-up fun-facts. If you actually decide to watch all of this stuff, you'll end up having seen the film at least three times by the time you're done!<br /><br />So what are you waiting for? Go off now and buy this! Spit-spot!\n",

      "a poor transfer to blu-ray, for a great film\n",
      "It is extremely annoying when a title is re-released in Blu-ray format with no restoration, or for that matter with no improvement on the image quality provided by the original DVD. Most films placed on Blu-ray stand out because of their crystal clear image and excellent sound. This makes it worth buying again, even if one possesses the original DVD copy, simply to have the improved performance on the screen, which may be even further enhanced by good quality equipment. This Blu-ray edition is far inferior to the original DVD edition, which used to have a number of interesting extras and the Blu-ray has absolutely none!<br /><br />As to the film itself, in my opinion, it still rates as one of the best comedies ever to be produced for the cinema. A very clever story, by John Cheese, with tremendous dialogue and very good acting from all the principals. There are some exaggerations in the plot, but this is true of most comedies.<br /><br />I noticed that the Blu-ray edition of this film will be released in the UK in August. I hope that after this long delay, this release will have the necessary improvements, especially in image quality, to make it worth a 5 star rating, and possibly induce one to acquire once more.\n",

Rathbone was an accomplished user of the foil and was to have said, \"Tyrone Power could have fenced Errol Flynn into a box.\"  I am in awe at times of the athletic abilities that some actors have.  Great movie, one of Hollywood's finest as far as I'm concerned. I highly recommend it for all audiences.  It is an example of a movie made without the electronic wizardry that prevails today\n",

      "See SAW\n",
      "My corny title is not just there to be funny in a stupid way, as it is also meant to convey to horror fans who have not seen SAW, thinking it to be another HOSTEL/HILLS HAVE EYES/any \"let's torture young people for fun instead of trying to be, you know, scary\" movie, that it's definitely worth their time. I have not seen SAW's sequels (though I liked this one enough to see the others), but I can say that this movie is more in the SE7EN kind of vein than the torture porn flicks we've been subjected to over the last few years. Yes, it is quite often gruesome, graphic, and disturbing, but it is all accredited to a very clever and darkly interesting premise.<br />We are introduced to our two protagonists (if they can be called that, as they have their vices) first, workaholic doctor Lawrence (Cary Elwes) and cocky youngster Adam (screenwriter Leigh Whannell), who awaken in a dark room resembling a larger version of a prison cell, each of them chained to pipes adjacent from each other. In the center is a dead body holding an unloaded gun with a gunshot wound to the head and a tape recorder. Adam and Lawrence each have tapes to be played on that recorder, on which a raspy voice, their captor, informs Lawrence that he must kill Adam by 6:00 that night, or he will kill Lawrence's wife and daughter. To further explain what could possibly be going on, Adam and Lawrence both tell certain stories about their past, leading to flashbacks where we are introduced to other key characters like policeman Det. David Tapp (Danny Glover) and his partner, Det. Steven Sing (Ken Leung), who are on the trail of the Jigsaw Killer, a sadistic serial killer who forces his victims to save their own lives through twisted puzzles and games. Lawrence believes this Jigsaw is their holder, and that Tapp believes Lawrence is somehow in cahoots with Jigsaw. More plot complications pile on top of each other, leading to the bloody, shocking finale, which whether you like it or not, is a doozy.<br />Writer Whannell and director James Wan, both newcomers, showcase a great confidence towards filmmaking, as Whannell's writing is very fluid and engrossing (I'm not saying he's David Mamet, but for someone not much older than college age he's very talented) and Wan's direction points toward a long future in filmmaking. Elwes should have won some sort of horror acting award or at least award for best desperate screaming and wailing (something I can't quite say for Whannell, a much better writer than he is an actor, though he's more than adequate in his role). I can't tell you if the sequels are able to have a nice psychological thriller along with the blood and guts, but this one has it and more.\n",

      "I Like This Movie for Reasons OTHER than What Was Billed.\n",
      "Mona Lisa smile.  Oh, goodness, what a trip.  Having gone to an all-girls high school in New England that has always been a feeder for Wellesley (and the Wellesley of today is quite different than in the 50's), I was admittedly curious about the film.  However, all my good sense told me to stay away.  I had enough feminism shoved down my throat at that school to last me a lifetime.  <p>That said, I eventually saw the film as a captive audience member on an overseas flight.  As they jumped in to the story, all the stereotypes came screaming out of the screen to me: stuffy old New England school, liberal from California, jaded students who know how to act the part for teachers, rich kids with parents on trustee boards, etc.  I think the movie relies on these well-worn characters because the writers certainly didn't do a very good job of developing them.  You just sort of fall into a familiar world.<p>My main criticisms of the film are:<br />1. As the movie progressed, I kept thinking that the storyline wasn't in sync with the character development.  They kept jumping ahead in the plot, assuming that you are keeping up with all the nuances of all the girls as they bloom in their senior year.  Really, this wasn't too hard as they kept the girls pretty one-dimensional.  <p>2. The whole 'Mona Lisa' concept was forced and ridiculous.  It didn't make sense that Julia Robert's lover called her that, and Kirsten Dunst's scene where she discusses this with her mother is laughable.  You knew what Dunst was getting at, but the film must have relied heavily on the audience's personal sentiment because they certainly didn't bring you there emotionally.  <p>3. And the ending...my goodness what a rip-off of 'Dead Poet's Society.'  Many movies have ripped off 'Dead Poet's Society,' but none seemed as clear as this.  I won't give it away, but don't worry...the girls didn't all stand up on their desks at least.<p>For all that, I don't think the movie was a complete failure.  I thought the following were noteworthy in the film:<br />1. First off, I need to praise Maggie Gyllenhaal's acting!!!  'Who?' you may ask.  She was the 4th one mentioned in all the previews and was the one that no-one really knew.  Her character could in some ways be a tired cliche, but she brought it to life and easily stole every scene she was in.  I was really mesmorized by her performance, and I look forward to more in the future.<p>2. Ginnifer Goodwin (the cello player) and Marcia Gay Harden (the old spinster) also turned very solid performances.<p>3. The fact that Julia Robert's character was ultimately able to turn down relationships with 2 charming men was fairly remarkable.  The fact that she had, needed and enjoyed these relationships so much shows that she is not anti-male or anti-marriage.  She merely has a mature understanding that marriage is not an absolute good and that neither of these men could ultimately stand by her.<p>4. What they did with Julia Styles' character (girl who was accepted into Yale Law School) was also impressive in this 'progressive' film.  That character perhaps single-handedly kept this from being just empty feminist propaganda.<p>5. Kirsten Dunst's role (the girl who gets married) & her relationship with her mother gives some spooky insight into 'advice' some girls were getting from their mothers.  The night her mother turns her away from her home is particularly painful.<p>Overall, I think the film is pretentious and completely misses what it aimed to be.  Additionally, I don't think Roberts, Dunst or Styles turned in particularly outstanding performances.  However, there was enough life there from random  sources to keep the movie afloat.\n",

      "Mona Lisa is definitely smiling\n",
      "Mona Lisa Smile is an inspiring film based on a time period when women are beginning to explore alternative roles in society other than the traditional roles of being a stay at home mother who concentrates on her husband's career and success--rather than her own.  Julia Roberts and her fellow actresses explore the roles of women as Julia plays an art professor who sets out to academically enlighten a group of already well-educated, rich girls attending a finishing school. Through this enlightening process she helps several of the students find their way, broaden their horizons, and in the process finds herself.  The movie deserves four stars because Julia's character not only lets the audience relate on a feminine level but on a humanitarian level as well.  The viewer can truly imagine the Mona Lisa smiling, if she were to watch Julia Robert's performance in this movie.\n",

      "Night and Day, Watch Cinderelly!\n",
      "One of Disney's classic films, \"Cinderella\" is now available on this two-disc Platinum Edition DVD set. It's a tale of a girl who has a dream and finds that though she's been dealt a hard lot in life, her dream can still come true.<br /><br />I think pretty much anyone that would be reading this would know this story, but just in case --- \"Cinderella\" features a girl, Cinderella (of course!), her two wicked stepsisters and her cruel and evil stepmother. Also living with her are a spoiled, mean-hearted cat, Lucifer and a group of cute little mice who can talk to her and she can talk to. Things weren't always like this for Cinderella. Her father was a kind man and things had always been nice for her, but when he passed away, her stepmother revealed her true colors. She took the family fortune for her and her daughters and made Cinderella a servant girl, forced to tend to their every whim. All of this has not made Cinderella bitter, though, and her heart and spirit remain as pure and beautiful as the day she was born.<br /><br />Now, things are starting to look up for Cinderella. She's made a new friend, a new mouse in the house and a royal ball has been announced. She really wants to go and is told that she can, if she has a lovely dress to wear. But when the wicked stepsisters ruin the dress, even she can't help but begin to despair... until a little magic happens.<br /><br />\"Cindrella\" is a powerful tale from beginning to end. The viewer gets involved not just with the story, but with the characters as well, even the affairs of the smallest characters of all, the mice. The story is moved along by several great songs including \"A Dream Is a Wish Your Heart Makes,\" \"Bibbidi Bobbidi Boo\" and \"So This is Love.\"<br /><br />This new Platinum Edition DVD set is a great way to rediscover the Disney \"Cinderella\" story. It features a digital presentation with enhanced picture and sound, 5.1 Surround Sound Theater Mix and French and Spanish Language tracks and subtitles.<br /><br />Of course, this wouldn't be a Platinum Edition DVD if it didn't have great special features. My favorite is \"Cinderella and Perry Como,\" a black-and-white segment featuring the live-action Cinderella, the voices of the mice and Perry Como. They talk about the movie and Perry Como expertly performs \"Bibbidi Bobbidi Boo\" along with the voices of the mice. There are several deleted songs, my personal favorite being the \"Cinderella Work Song.\" This is an alternate take on the song performed in the movie by the mice as they make their dress for Cinderella. Cinderella fantasizes about what it would be like if there are more of her.<br /><br />Other bonuses include publicity pictures and characters sketches, a short segment from \"The Mickey Mouse Club,\" a \"Laugh-o-Gram\" that's a simplified verison of the Cinderella story and the promos for the original theatrical release and subsequent video releases and theatrical rerelease. There are also games, including a Princess Pajama Party.<br /><br />Perhaps the most unusual special feature is the \"Cinderella Stories.\" Apparently hoping to lure sports fans, or get girls' fathers interested, these are ESPN segments about various sports teams that won great victories against tough odds.<br /><br />All in all, a great package. I'm now interested to see the upcoming Cinderella III, for which a short trailer was included in this release. Apparently the Stepmother gains some sort of black magic power and takes Cinderella's happily-ever-after away. Harsh!\n",

Then there are 4 featurettes - \"Digital Destruction\", \"Enlisting The AirForce\", \"An Icon Returns\", \"Stan Winston Shop\". These four total 11:30. So is it worth it to spend the extra cash for just a hand full of extras? I guess, but I would have loved to have more extras including a commentary.\n",

      "Terrific Show Deserves Better DVD Package\n",
      "The problem with \"The Office: Season One\" is not with the show itself. Steve Carell, who broke through big-time in 2005 with not only this series but his feature film \"The 40 Year Old Virgin\", leads a fine ensemble cast in this documentary style comedy about the daily business practices of a Pennsylvania-based paper company. It's a witty, frequently funny, and sometimes painfully honest look at the way a boss treats his employees. No, the problem once again lies with the DVD's distributor, Universal. This is a brand new show, yet the episodes on the DVD seem to have a murky, bland appearance, unlike the episodes which are seen weekly on NBC. I complained about this problem with the \"Miami Vice: Season One\" DVD, but at least you can justify that somewhat because the episodes were from twenty years ago. Universal, what are you DOING? Please take the time and effort to put out a better DVD set. Of the extras available, there are a generous amount of deleted scenes from each of Season One's six episodes, but no bloopers, which is a disappointment. I don't know if Universal actually listens to their customers, but when I go out to buy Season Two of this excellent show on DVD, they'd better show some marked improvement. The fans deserve better.\n",

      "Nothing Funnier\n",
      "Nothing Sacred is often referred to as a screwball comedy. Granted it has Carole Lombard the ultimate screwball heroine and other elements which suggest this form of comedy. However, it does not in the end so much resemble films like Bringing up Baby as it anticipates the later satires of Preston Sturges. Whichever way it is classified though, Nothing Sacred remains one of the best comedies of the thirties or indeed of any era. <p>This film, with its story of an apparently dying young woman, has an added poignancy for viewers watching it today. Lombard would be dead by 1942 and a real national heroine also with a navy warship named after her. The fiction at times seems to look ahead to the fact and thus the story becomes moving as well as funny. <p>The print of the film on this Lumivision DVD is on the whole good.  There are some scenes especially at the beginning of the film where the early Technicolor print has been damaged. This means that there is some flickering and some separation of the colours. For the most part however, the film looks almost perfect with the vibrant colours so typical of thirties Technicolor. It is a joy to see Carole Lombard in colour and something of a surprise also, for her hair looks redder than expected. There are one of two slight jumps where the continuity of the film has been broken and this may account for the running time of the film, at 73 minutes, being slightly shorter than that listed in some sources. <p>The extras on this DVD are welcome but rather disappointing. The two Sennett short comedies are not very funny and really show that he had not moved on at all from his early pioneering days. These shorts are of interest mainly because they allow us to see a young and barely recognizable Lombard toiling away in her pre-stardom days. The DVD also includes a very damaged trailer for Nothing Sacred and some interesting if rather brief home movies with Lombard and Gable.\n",

      "Glorious, Wondrous, the  Greatest Rudolph of Them All!\n",
      "Rudolph, the Red-Nosed Reindeer is indeed the most marvelous Christmas film ever! It is one of many superb animated films written by a great man named Romeo Muller. Rudolph is doubtless his best-loved work. I remember watching the film as a child, delighted and enraptured by the story that it told. Do you remember? Sam the Snowman as narrator (voiced and sung in the performance of a lifetime by Burl Ives); Rudolph the misfit and rejected reindeer; Rudolph's friend, Hermy the Elf, also a misfit because he doesn't like to make toys but wants to be a dentist; Yukon Cornelius, the prospector who befriends them both; the Abominable Snowmonster of the North (whom Yukon, in prospector slang, invariably calls a \"bumble\"); the Island of Misfit Toys, and its winged lion ruler, King Moonracer; and many other characters and story threads. The presentation, interweaving, and resolution of all of these elements is positively Shakespearean in deftness, wit, poetic beauty and brevity of expression, depth, pathos, joy, moral instruction, and the sense that all ends as indeed it should. Grounded in a deep and sparkling love of all creation, these qualities characterize all of Romeo Muller's films.  If you will see it devotedly--indeed, if you will see any and all of Romeo's films--you will become a finer, more compassionate, and a more truly loving human being.\n",

      "Brilliant \"Report\"\n",
      "What do you get when you team one of the world's most bankable actors with the greatest director alive today? In the case of Tom Cruise and Steven Spielberg, the result is \"Minority Report\", a thrilling and intriguing crime drama which will most certainly become a sci-fi classic.  The year is 2054, and Washington, D.C. has been murder-free for six years, thanks to the implementaion of Pre-Crime, in which gifted psychics (or Pre-Cogs) are used to predict murders before they occur. The Pre-Crime police force, led by Chief John Anderton(Cruise), are able to arrest and \"halo\" the accused before the crime is committed. Anderton believes fully in the pre-crime system, despite the skepticism shown by federal agent Danny Witwer(Colin Farrell), who has been assigned to find flaws in pre-crime. It doesn't take long for Anderton himself to be predicted of committing a murder, which leads him to believe that Witwer set him up in order to make pre-crime fail. Nonetheless, Anderton must go on the run to prove his innocence....or is he unknowingly on the path to murder?  This was undoubtedly the best film I saw in 2002(and I saw quite a few). It's a huge rebound for Cruise, who was last seen in 2001's dismal \"Vanilla Sky\". I never particularly cared for most of his other performances, but he is remarkably good in this film. Oscar-worthy? Quite possibly. And Spielberg demonstates why he is the greatest director of the last 30 years. Yes, he's had some misses(\"1941\", \"Always\", \"A.I.:Artificial Intelligence\"), but as with all hs great films, he can thrill you one moment, elicit a laugh the next, even scare the pants off you, but his best films are the ones you talk about afterwards. No, \"Minority Report\" is not the most interesting title of a film, but it does figure into the plot. What's most surprising is the film's rating-somehow, it received a PG-13, when it should have been rated R for violence, suggested drug use, language and adult subject matter. However, it does not change my rating, as the film is a marvelous blend of special effects, top-notch acting and a fascinating story, which is hard to come by in a lot of films these days. See it!\n",

      "Minority Report definitely ranks as one of the best future-theme movies of all time. Although not as groundbreaking as The Matrix or visually stunning as Blade Runner, it has it's own pro's.<p>In a future where future crimes are predicted using triplets or 'Pre Cogs' with the ability to foresee events yet to come, the Police Officer in charge and support of the device himself (Tom Cruise) is accused of a murder that he has yet to commit. Though he believes that he is innocent, the squad doesn't, so Cruise sets out on his journey to find the truth.<p>The storyline for the movie is interesting, very thought provoking. A lot of what is talked about sounds complicated at first, but listening closely will reveal that they are really talking about the Minority Report of Cruise. Listen even more closely and you'll understand the entire movie, otherwise you will be lost.<p>Good actors playing good characters, impressive special effects, quality action, and a deepening plot - Minority Report is definitely worth the price of admission.\n",

      "Deceptive or Realistic???\n",
      "It's interesting to see that there's so much activity for this film since it's been released for quite awhile.  However, perhaps Depp's recent performances have drawn attention to it.  After watching him in \"Pirates of the Caribbean,\" I realized that he might be one of the best young actors in our time.  I mean he can really act like different people...not just take type-cast rolls.  And so I wanted to see his work here.<p>What I found was a blatant skewing of a storyline to engage people while communicating a specific message.  While most intelligent books & movies now try to show how multi-dimensional everyone is...how difficult it is to simply cast someone as \"good\" or \"bad\"...this movie does the reverse.  As characters are introduced, you are quickly able to assign them to one of 2 camps: good enlighted folks or bad religious uptight folks.  (There's also one bad drunken guy who is taken in by the bad religious folks for their own agenda.)<p>What unfolds, then, is not a film about the transformation of human nature or the triumph of hero in a realistic set of circumstances.  Rather, you have an \"unlikely\" heroine cast in a role where she's bound to succeed in proving how good she ultimately is.  (She has all good people on her side, of course).  This mysterious woman who works on Sunday & has an illegitmate daughter basically acts as the religious figure of the movie.  She heals the sick, protects the vulnerable, brings together the lonely and even, yes, loves her enemies.  The bad people are eventually either \"converted\" to her side or made to look absolutely ridiculous.  They are degraded and dismissed.<p>Depp's character makes an interesting entrance towards the end of this movie.  As usual, I think he played his role well.  He plays the intelligent, intriguing, competent gypsy he's supposed to be.  I like his character, but I wished there was more of him.<p>In the end, I had very mixed feelings about the film.  I felt that the artsy people behind the film (not necessarily the author of the original book) were using this film to express their own internal emotions.  It was like they poured themselves into this heroine and tried to make you understand how good & sincere they are - despite their unconventional lifestyles.  <p>And it is engaging.  I legitimately liked the heroine & hoped she would succeed.  I felt like I had to use all my intellectual power (which is, admittedly, minimal) to pull back from the emotional draw of the movie in order to analyze the realisticness of the plot.  As I said at the beginning, my ultimate feeling is that this is a blatantly skewed plot used to communicate a message.  And that's not necessarily a bad thing...perhaps it's just good to be aware of.\n",

Finally, he is down to nothing but self-preservation and survival.  Lizbeth Scott is Payne's loyal love interest and Dan Duryea plays a convincing and clever villain.  There are insinuations of 'McCarthyism' in the film, but they are too simplistic to be taken seriously.  The career of Senator Joseph (Tailgunner Joe) McCarthy had a lot more to it than could be talked about here.<br /><br />I thought the color balance, sound and image clarity were very good for this DVD.\n",

      "Before watching Bully knowing Larry Clark had directed it gave me a taste for what it might be like. Based on a true story I was taken in by the whole thing instantly. The story was a great basis for an even greater movie. Larry Clarks choice of actors was perfect. Bijou Phillips as the care free, experimental Ali was just right. Nich Stahl as the Bully, played it with such truthfulness, that in certain scenes was disturbing to see. Brad Renfro as Marty - the initial victim of Bobby's violence. Plays it with a perfect sense of fear but of also the need to rebel against him and eventually stop running. <p>In typical Larry style the movie uses very unusual camera angles to make things as real to life as possible. Larry Clark also likes to shock and have an impact on his viewers - small elements like the umbearable camera spinning round a group of teens for well over 1 minute made me turn away dizzy, also using an unwanted shot of Bijou's crotch, it served no purpose.<br />The movie is very real, Larry hasn't left any stone unturned. High amounts of ...frolics between the teens and even the murder itself are as real and are played with as much truth as possible.<br />I watched the first 10 minutes and I had to turn it off - because I was brought face to face with a grim reality - that was done in such a believable way that I had to register what I had seen. It was quite shocking to see some of the actors as their characters. For example Michael Pitt went from innocent and loving Henry in Dawsons Creek to a guy who has lots ...[of relations] and would commit ...[crimes] As uncomfortable as the scenes were, the acting was at such a high level you'd never know they were phased by it. <p>Although Bully is initailly a grim story of ...[crimes], I think Bully is on some level a fun, entertaining teenage flick, its the violent elements in the story that change the whole feel to it.<br />Bully has fresh new talent and a kicking soundtrack. Larry Clark has always been interested in youth..., in this movie he has combined that and applied it to a gripping story.<br />Bully has been a real eye opener. Its been a week or so since I watched it and I still can't stop thinking about it. Walking away from a movie and forgetting about it is a wasted 2 hours - walking away and thinking about it weeks after and wanting to know more - well thats a job well done.\n",

      "At this time, I am on what you may call a National Lampoon investigation. You may have noticed the makers of classics like Animal House and Vacation are releasing 10 movies a year in hopes to get a hit. So I have been watching their latest films. When I reached Lost Reality, the idea of shows that could never air sounded funny enough.<br /><br /> Oh, it did, my friends, but after watching this, I had many emotions, none good. Disgust, confusion, and...well, more confusion. Is this supposed to be funny? Are these real show ideas compiled by NL? On the box it says there are 'creators' for the film. Creators of the made-up pilots, creators of a show that found horrible show ideas, what? Who can I blame for this travesty?<br /><br /> I know these shows are SUPPOSED to be horrible, horrible shows, but aren't they also supposed to make the viewer laugh? Watching someone drink a liquid that makes you barf to get cash and then lick it up is toe-curling whether it's real or not. It LOOKS real (they're filmed like actual reality shows), so are these twisted people doing this to real people? Take 'The Whore,' where three men are set up with a paid prostitute. Do these men know about this? Who's in on the joke? The reason shows like Punk'd, Candid Camera, or the Jamie Kennedy Experiment are (or in some cases were) funny is because we're in on the joke with Ashton Kutcher and the actors he's using, we know it's Jamie Kennedy, and so on. Also, the gags done are funny. In the excerpt in Lost Reality called 'Casting Couch,' we have a man hiring women for movies and such based on whether or not they will read topless. Are these women aware? Is this man subjecting real (admittedly gullible and stupid) women to this? I somehow managed a chuckle or two, only because I saw what kind of shows they were spoofing. Reality shows can be brain-numbingly cheesy, which 'He Said, She Said' explores until it goes overboard (and below overboard, and below, and below...). And just when you think it's over, it throws in another 'Money' sketch, where a man craps his pants for money, and the camera ZOOMS IN ON THE CRAP.<br /><br /> All I can say is that National Lampoon has lost its touch whether this is real or not, because if it's fake, it's not funny at all, and if it's real, these men have no, repeat, no compassion for humanity.\n",

      "A Silent David and Goliath\n",
      "Tol'able David is one of the finest silent films which I have seen. It seems more realistic than many silents. This is partly because of the location shooting, partly because the story is neither overly melodramatic nor comic. Barthelmess as the David character gives a wonderful performance while Torrance as the Goliath character is only just a little over the top in his villainy. He was perhaps more suited to the comic monster type of his later Captain Hook. The real revelation though, is Hulette. She is almost completely forgotten now, but clearly had great talent. Her performance is realistic and charming. She is quite simply adorable. The print on this DVD has been formed from separate sources. Thus it looks slightly different from scene to scene. There is some damage, but it rarely detracts. It is however, slightly distracting to see variations in the tinting. It is inconsistent to have one green scene when the rest of the movie uses greys and browns. One of the best features of this DVD is the music, which is a series of wonderful folksy tunes which fit in so well with the action that even David's harmonica playing is included. As an added bonus the DVD includes an interesting interview with director Henry King and some useful, extensive sleeve notes. Tol'able David is not as well known as many silent films, but really it ought to be considered as among the very best.\n",

Those morons in hollywood ran a few names of successful directors in hollywood at the time, and out of what must have been a very short list, some no brained prat asked Paul Anderson if he wanted to direct it.<br /><br />Paul Anderson.............<br /><br />How can you give this film, of all films, to Paul Anderson. He simply can't direct. Anyone that can take a format as simple as an empty house with a bunch of zombies, and make Resident evil out of it (One of the worst films of all time) obviously has no sense of how to make a film whatsoever. He also wrote the only review of the film that appears on any of the posters. Doesn't that say something? That nobody would give it a good review so he had to do it himself.<br /><br />Oh well. It good have been great this film, but that's what happens when money is the key issue.<br /><br />Doesn't matter anyway, I'm sure that all those 8 year old kids that can legally watch it on their own will enjoy it.\n",

Although they have all moved on in life, they are all the same sexually frustrated people who left high school a year ago. Stifler has not changed one bit...he's even more ready to spread himself among young girls. Jim is back to his normal self...making a fool of himself with unusual scenerios which often lead to total humiliation..but this summer things start to change for the better. Oz remains in love with Heather and battles a whole summer without her...cue interesting phone conversations!! And Finch...still obsessed with the one and only Stiflers Mom. Lots of funnny moments and even more outrageous goings on. Many people thought AP2 would not satisfy but hey I think its great!<br />Keep going back for seconds..you know you can't resist!\n",

      "Before I ever was ordained as a minister, I saw this movie on the movie screen three times, and  have seen it many times since I was ordained. (Thus, I have seen it a countless number of times between the ages of twelve and my present age of sixty-four.) I'm glad I have the dvd of it now. While the scene of the meeting of Moses and God at the burning bush,... and as well the scene of the parting of the Red Sea...stick out in my mind, all through the movie I felt a euphoric \"you-are-there\" feeling of the story which took me back to 1500(?) B.C. Though liberties were taken with the drama, it did follow very closely the story line in the Bible.<br />Did any movie, barring none, ever have a more perfect cast? Charlton Heston was arguably the best for the role of Moses, the strong, awe-inspiring, sometimes hot-headed leader of the children of Israel. The Pharoah was just as mean as Yul Brynner, I dare say. Anne Baxter, (whom I always considered a \"put-on\") was convincing as the tempting Nefretiri. Yvonne DeCarlo was adept as the physically attractive, sweet, and understanding Sephora. (In the Bible, the name is actually \"Zipporah\".) Martha Scott was molded to play Moses' mother Jochebed. John Derek definitely was the strong type which fit Joshua. The seasoned actor Sir Cedric Hardwicke acted very well the older Pharoah Sethi. Vincent Price was the \"perfectly\" mean and cold-hearted task master Bacca. Edward G. Robinson portrayed well the traitor Dathan. Debra Paget was adorable. Nina Foch, who assumed roles of both heartless and loving women, did a very good turn as Pharoah's daughter, Moses' adopted mother who was so loving. Again, the entire cast was par excellence.<br />Naturally and needless to say, the color and the \"trick photography\" of so many of the scenes also made the movie so realistic and enhancing.<br />All the way through the story...from Egypt, to Midian, to Mount Sinai, to Egypt again, to the Sinai desert and to Mount Sinai again, and then to the Promised Land (which Moses was forbidden to enter) the story of Moses and the exodus was presented so well. For Cecil B. DeMille...who wrote, produced, and directed the film...this was his magnus opus. (Winston Churchhill might have said that this was his \"finest hour\".)

      "Firstly, you're amazed by the alien ship that appears, curious about the contingency plan, and then completely blown away by the explosions and special effects. This is American patriotism at its very best, yet you forget all of that with the amount of action, comedy and typical plotlines. Ok, so the acting wasn't THAT great, but you can watch this film a hundred times and never get bored. There one liners always crack you up, and once again, America is always the one that saves the day! <p>A simple plot - aliens threaten the world's (more so America's) existence and someone (America) has to do something about it. With a cast led by Bill Pullman, Jeff Goldblum and (at the time) an aspiring Will Smith, that were all very good to watch, not forgetting the rather nice looking Vivica A. Fox as Smith's fianc? I can't really put a flaw in this film since it was great fun to see. God bless America! <p>Done in true US Military style, 'Independence Day' is an entertaining, patriotic watch - one big dose of eye candy which can be seen again and again.\n",

      "Take Nothing for Granted!\n",
      "If you're a fan of Tom Hanks, than this movie is a must-see!  A story of a man who loses everything important to him in his life, because on one fateful plane trip he is left stranded on a remote desert island...for FOUR YEARS!<br /><br />Much of the movie early on provides foreshadowing for events to arise later.  There is the love story intertwined within Hanks struggle to survive (albeit they are a married couple).  However, like the rest of the film, even that doesn't turn out the way you'd expect!<br /><br />My only gripe about the film is, I wish they would have shown a bit more of Hanks' on the island.  He was there for FOUR years and the way it was filmed, it jumps from the beginning of his new life, to shortly before he is finally saved.  I would have liked to have seen a bit more of the time in between.  I can understand however because it was a lengthy movie as is and that would have only made it longer.<br /><br />Check this out if you can.  After seeing this movie, it'll definetly make you appreciate things a bit more and maybe help you not take so much of your life for granted.\n",

      "A different take for the Walking Dead\n",
      "Walking Dead has been hugely popular in the comic scene for awhile now, yet the introduction of this AMC show skyrocketed the whole franchise into fame and notability among not just the 'nerdy' markets yet the TV market itself. This surge of popularity has given the franchise an amazing amount of room to branch out to video games, novels, collectibles, etc. So the second season of the TV show was bound to have a lavish collectors edition, and while it isn't a letdown, there are some annoying drawbacks.<br /><br />For start, the \"head-case\" is pretty cool. It does come from a pretty iconic scene exclusive to the second season of the Walking Dead. The blu-ray discs fit perfectly inside, and the opening/closing mechanism seems pretty solid, yet I keep them with the other blu-ray discs because I see no reason to hide them inside the head. The detail of head seems similar to a high quality Halloween mask up-close, yet looks fantastic from a distance away, and I also love the big title-words underneath the head. Overall, it looks really awesome on a shelf, I have mine on my shelf dedicated to Walking Dead where it holds all my books, issues, and blu-rays of the franchise.<br /><br />The season itself is pretty awesome, I've found that most readers of the book wish it stuck closer to the book and went through these events much faster. (For comparison, the first two season of this show only cover the first twelve issues of the book, and each issue is very short.) Yet I find the second season to be a more dramatic, realistic, and character driven version of the book. There's more time for each character, and more pacing for each event. There's still certainly some issues with the show, most notably two of the characters are jaw-droppingly more stupid in the show, and some other characters are seemingly not in the show.<br /><br />The video and audio quality is terrific. Due to the nature of the show, there's a very gritty look with plenty of film grain, yet it all looks great. There's a general lack of a soundtrack, so there's plenty of time to notice all the immersive background sounds, most notably a very subtle effect of a horde of zombies moaning into a collective disturbing feeling that is used numerous times. While the more intense sounds of gunshots and yelling all stay crisp and clear.<br /><br />This release is spread along four blu-rays, so it's obvious there's a very decent amount of extras here. Yet, the first season had at least one audio commentary on each episode, while this one only has audio commentary on five of the thirteen episodes (and the 20 minute collection of the webisodes). The rest of the special features are pretty awesome, a huge amount of behind the scene and interview featurettes which each clock in around seven minutes. The best part is probably the 30 minutes of deleted scenes.<br /><br />Now while this release is pretty awesome, there is a looming threat of there being another release of the second season in order to get another $40-$50 out of the diehard fans. This was done with the first season, and it could very well be done with this one with the rest of the audio commentaries. Yet even if that does happen, one could still be happy with this release just for the zombie head-case.\n",

      "Freedom\n",
      "It is as simple as this. There's nothing, really, to &quot;get&quot;. This movie is about freedom and peace. It's about how the tyranny of the &quot;Status Quo&quot; stifles the spirit of man, and with bleak outcome, illustrates how this wreckless hatred of difference, and unacceptance of our fellows, ends in destruction of peace. Those with baseless pride, always quick to judge and condemn, are the real villains, despite the protagonists' lawlessness, they bring no harm to anyone, which is in stark contrast to the majority of those they encounter. <p>I keep reading reviews on how many &quot;sided with the rednecks&quot;. All I can say is that if you find yourself doing just that, then you really must delve further into the nature of freedom. *REAL* freedom. <p>That is the essense of this film. It is the one word of description to label it and define it. The protagonists' are on a quest to discover what it is to be free, whilst indulging in it. The realisation of the farmer's existence is an example of where they see how freedom is manifest in different forms. Despite the choice of the expression, the farmer and the (anti)heroes share a similar viewpoint on life. <p>This may very well be the most patriotic film ever made. It is a shame that so many can't look past the surface to see that fact.\n",

      "All college movies begin and end with a little film called National Lampoon's Animal House. A foray into movies for the first time for National Lampoon, having succeeded on radio and as a magazine, this raucous classic has everything you'd want in a comedy: memorable characters & quotes, partying, a great soundtrack, and a group of unknowns that became stars overnight.<br /><br /> The basic plot: freshmen Kent Dorfman (Stephen Furst) and Larry Kroger (Tom Hulce) are rejected from the preppy Omega fraternity and head to the Delta house, where Kent's older brother Fred went. Delta turns out to be the party frat, aka 'animal house,' at Faber College, and Dean Wormer (John Vernon) wants them shut down and puts them on double secret probation. But Delta won't die, so one toga party, road trip, horse killing, food fight, and parade destruction later, the Deltas beat the rules.<br /><br /> Saying Animal House always brings to mind John Belushi as Bluto Blutarsky, the 7-year Delta member whose grade point average is 0.0 and who gives fine advice like, \"Start drinking heavily.\" Bluto is the best character hands down, and his speech to get the Deltas back up when they're down is classic, yelling, \"Was it over when the Germans bombed Pearl Harbor? Hell no!\"<br /><br /> So if you haven't see Animal House, you basically haven't lived. See it now, then watch it again. GATOR!\n",

      "Two solid Arnold movies\n",
      "While neither of these movies compare to classics such as \"Total Recall\" or \"Terminator 2: Judgement Day,\" they are still solid action films.<br /><br />\"Eraser\" features Arnold as a CIA agent who has the job of erasing witnesses backgrounds in order to protect them.  When Vanessa Williams is targeted by the villians, he must protect her in order to save the country.  This is a good film with some great action scenes.  This also features some of Arnold's better acting.<br /><br />\"Collateral Damage\" is another entertaining film.  Arnold stars as a fireman who goes to Columbia seeking revenge.  The film was originally planned for an October 2001 release.  However, the theme of terrorism took a different tone after September 11, 2001.  Wisely the film was postponed for a while.  I found Arnold's acting to be a little off in this film, especially toward the beginning where he has to communicate grief and loss. Once he gets to Columbia, the film picks up quite a bit and is a very good action film.<br /><br />The DVD set is a flipper.  \"Collateral Damage\" has a nice collection of special features.  Both films are presented in widescreen.<br /><br />When I originally saw \"Eraser\", I felt that maybe it was time for Arnold to retire (I like it more now than I did then).  He continued to star in films, but the returns at the box office were diminishing.  \"Collateral Damage\" faired poorly at the box office, although I think that had as much to do with bad timing than a loss of interest in Arnold's films.  However, in the latter, the Austrian Oak seems a little tired of the whole genre.  After the success of \"Terminator 3\" he would run for governor.  With his term coming to a close, perhaps he will return to making movies.\n",

      "I both read the book and saw the movie years ago when it was first released.  My recollection is that while Jesus does \"marry and/or consummate\" with Mary Magdeline as many of the reviewers before me have mentioned, she immediately dies, and he then marries Mary the sister of Lazarus, with whom he raises a family.<br /><br />Regardless, I found the duality of man/God as presented in both the book and the movie to be incredibly moving.  In fact the \"temptation\" placed before Jesus in this story seems far more powerful to me than even those placed before him in the books of the New Testament.<br /><br />All in all, I loved the book and the soundtrack, and liked the movie.\n",

      "Don't worry, America. Bruce is back.\n",
      "Bruce Willis brings his A game to this movie and it's one of the summer's better shows. Nobody can take it and dish it out better than Bruce Willis. Of the 4 movies in the series, I'd rate this one a strong #2. Yes, it's over the top non-stop action, but no one goes to see these shows expecting another Masterpiece Theater production of a Jane Austin novel. The stunts are the thing and this movie abounds in them. Bruce and his computer geek boy wonder work surprisingly well together. The only thing that keeps the movie from all time action film classic status is a fairly lackluster performance from Tim Olyphant, suprisingly so for fans of Deadwood. To make John's heroics truely meaningful he must have the proper foil, a worthy enemy. Alas, Tim is no Alan Rickman, who really made the first film so memorable. Neither Tim nor the script writers did anything unique or especially interesting with the character. Otherwise, I would have given this at least 4 in the genre.\n",

      "He's an easy guy to like, but a tough man to kill...\n",
      "Well, he at least should be an easy guy to like, and has been for 20 years. In this however, the wonderful character of John McClain failed to make an appearance. First off, no swearing. Well, I don't care if a movie has swearing or not, but this is Die Hard, and that's the Die Hard character. He's a guy's guy, he's brutal, he breaks peoples necks, tells them he's gonna cook and eat them after they're dead, refers to people as 'f**k face' a lot and has one of the most well known movie lines of all time, which incidentally, includes the word f**k. So, why did they have to make it without swearing? Seriously, from an artistic point of view, or simply in respect of the character and the films that came before it, it should have had swearing. Bruce Willis isn't too old for the part, but the script was lousy and played off like he was. They just made him a dumb computer illiterate who everyone thought was stupid. Stuff like covering a web cam and whispering isn't funny, it's just ruining the integrity of the character. He felt more like a super hero than a real guy, never once had an expression of fear or immediacy on his face, and was always happy to go to the next location when John McClain's role in every movie is that he always wants out.<br /><br />First major problem with the film was the script. There was no hook, no one thing for him to get his teeth into. The movie wasn't claustrophobic at all and there was no time constraint. The result was that it took place over a fairly long period of time for a Die Hard film, rather than one evening to night or during the day. Every film is done in one go, in one bad situation. Die Hard with a Vengeance has the line when Samuel L' Jackson says 'You're about to have a very bad day' and us Die Hard fans were thinking, 'Alright, here we go again'.<br /><br />Well, not this time.<br /><br />The bad guy in the film was probably the worst bad guy I've ever seen, and that goes for all movies. He was so weedy and wimpy. There is no way in a million years that he would have kept McClain's daughter alive, or handed her the phone at certain points. She didn't need to be there, and he would have killed her.<br /><br />God bless Kevin Smith, but he didn't belong in this film.<br /><br />Why is it, that at the start of the film, the bad guys were sending viruses to kids houses who were playing Gears of War (Nice product placement there). But seriously, what's the point? John McClain knocks on the guys door before the pc explodes, the kid answers it because he doesn't know anyone wants him dead, so why can't the terrorist guys just knock on these kids doors, pop a gun between the crack of it, shoot them dead and walk out? Might attract less attention than a massive explosion!! But no, we have to settle for the PG rating virus explosions, because people can't die properly in films anymore.<br /><br />Why was the film so shiny? Why were there so many unnecessary cuts? It seems like all movies today are made for people with ADD. Where's the pacing, the build up, the silence before the storm?<br /><br />Why was the dialog so awful? Watch the scene in the limo in number 1 with Argyle and how great the banter between them is. Then watch the awful, awful, AWFUL dialog he has in the car in this one, when Justin Long says something along the lines of 'You watch the news!!! Oh my God, you watch the news!! What's wrong with you, do you know how much they lie to you on the news!!!!! The news! My God, you watch the news!!! And you listen to popular music!!!' ...<br /><br />Jesus.<br /><br />Somebody actually got paid to write that? I was sitting there thinking 'I'd rather watch the news than this lousy excuse for a Die Hard film'.<br /><br />Why, of all things, was the Die Hard title screen different to how it's been in every movie so far? Die hard always slams in from the left and right of the screen, but not in this, they just said, 'no, screw that, forget the old films, no one cares'. Well, how would you like it if someone changed the opening STAR WARS title, and just blipped it on instead?<br /><br />This is easily the worst of the four, and Die Hard 2, despite me loving it, isn't a great film and shouldn't have been too hard to top or at least equal. All those that say Vengeance was weak, I suggest you watch it again. The script is great, and it's the only film directed by John McTeirnan aside from the first and it shows through.<br /><br />John Mclaine is a great character. The Die Hard films are fantastic action films. His lines stick forever, for example;<br /><br />'Come out to the coast, we'll get together, have a few laughs'<br />'Thanks for the advice'<br />'Welcome to the party pal'<br />'No f******g s**t lady, does it like I'm ordering a pizza!'<br />'If you're not part of the situation then you're part of the problem, quit being part of the f*****g problem and put the other guy back on'<br />'Ehh, sorry Hans, wrong guess, would you like to go for double jeopardy where the stakes could really change?'<br />'What's this a tag team?'<br />'For once I'd just like a nice quiet Christmas ... but here I am, climbing around in f*****g tin cans'<br />'How can the same s**t happen to the same guy twice'<br />'Well, now that you mention it, I have been feeling a burning sensation between my toes'<br />'He'll feel better when he looks in the back seat'<br />'Laundry day'<br />'Anyone catch the lottery last night ... see, I got the ticket right here'<br />'Say hello to your brother'<br />'Yippee Ki ya Mother F****r'<br /><br />These are only a few, but you find me anything in live free or Die Hard that even comes close to these lines or scenes. All we get is him doing his McClain laugh since the script writers are practically brain dead and waste every opportunity for a good line. People have told me that a great line in this one is 'I'm gonna go kill this guy and get my daughter back, or get my daughter and kill this guy.'<br /><br />Do I really have to comment on that? It's like he can't speak English. He just said the same thing twice, and neither time was it even witty!<br /><br />The problem nowadays, is that Hollywood sell their films based on the action and the effects. It was nice to see real stunts in this film, but so what? He wasn't jumping off the top of a building as it explodes behind him, and what was real in the film was so badly edited that the stunts lost their impact. Way back when, there was a nice balance. If they wanted to make an action film, there was no CG, so they had to do the stunts. If they were going to take the time to get them right, then they were going to make damn sure the script was good so the stunts were worth doing. Sadly, this no longer seems to be the case, and Live Free or Die Hard was just another action film full of plot holes and no substance.<br /><br />Oh, and that Bowman guy sucked.\n",

      "This movie is revealing, hilarious, smart, a little bit madcap and touching all at once. I loved it. It opens up a world I don't know much about and presents characters that I love knowing about. The road trip storyline is almost a romp at times, but the film has emotional depth (the roles are really well-crafted), cultural insights (Mexican immigration), documentary qualities (the perils of border-crossing) and some killer visuals, too. So it's an all-around awesome movie.\n",

      "Very subtle and touching movie about the effects of war....\n",
      "Several things:  this movie is not what I expected. I had some vague idea there was fighting involved, and perhaps some racing around, and figured there would be a big \"showdown\" ~ after all, it's Clint Eastwood.<br /><br />Also, I once had a huge fight with my ex, who wanted me to see \"Saving Private Ryan\". His argument: \"War is an important topic and you need to see this movie.\" Mine: \"I know it's an important topic, and I don't *need* to see a movie to know it.\"<br /><br />So, having said that, again, not what I expected. Although I am can be tender-hearted, I rarely cry at movies. I did at this one. And I think people *should* see this movie to learn what happens when the war is over.<br /><br />Clint's character is an old, racist, white man, who, after fighting in Korea, spent his life working for Ford. He has an old Ford truck, and a 1972 Gran Torino, his pride and joy, that incidentally he helped build. His wife has passed on, his kids hate him, he grandchildren only care about what he might leave them, he practically has no friends left, and his neighborhood is now filled with Hmong. Foreigners. Who he hates, wishing they would just leave the neighborhood - or at least keep their yards up.<br /><br />His neighbors hate him, and wish *he* would leave the neighborhood.<br /><br />Stalemate, until the young boy next door tries to steal his Gran Torino as his initiation into a gang, and he catches the boy doing it.<br /><br />I won't go too much into the details, but of course, bad things happen then. Good things as well.  And we learn, in a subtle way, how that war affected him. And his family and children. And his foreign neighbors, and their children. And what \"sacrifice\" means. I highly, highly recommend this movie. It will touch your heart.\n",
